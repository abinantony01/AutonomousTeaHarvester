The tea plantations of Idukki, nestled in the picturesque landscapes of Kerala, India, represent a vital sector of the region's economy and cultural heritage. With its lush greenery and rolling hills, Idukki's tea estates have long been renowned for producing some of the finest teas in the world. However, the labor-intensive nature of tea harvesting poses significant challenges to the industry, including labor shortages and rising costs. To address these challenges and usher in a new era of efficiency and sustainability, innovative technologies such as autonomous tea harvesting systems Came to our mind Because of this. The integration of advanced technologies, such as the Jetson Nano and Pixhawk flight controller, revolutionizes traditional tea harvesting methods in Idukki. The Jetson Nano, with its powerful GPU and AI capabilities, serves as the central processing unit of the autonomous tea harvesting system. Leveraging its processing prowess, the Jetson Nano analyzes sensor data and executes sophisticated algorithms for tasks such as leaf detection, disease recognition, and path planning. This enables precise and efficient harvesting operations, optimizing yield quality and quantity while reducing labor requirements. In conjunction with the Jetson Nano, the Pixhawk flight controller for ArduRover provides precise navigation and control for the robotic vehicles employed in tea harvesting. Equipped with gyro stabilization, these vehicles navigate through the undulating terrain of Idukki's tea plantations with ease, avoiding obstacles and ensuring smooth operation of the robotic cutters during harvesting. GPS-based locations and advanced tree avoidance algorithms further enhance navigation accuracy, enabling seamless traversal of the plantation landscape. Moreover, the autonomous tea harvesting system incorporates safety measures and real-time monitoring capabilities to ensure the safety and efficiency of operations. In the event of low battery levels, an auxiliary power algorithm facilitates a safe return home, mitigating the risk of disruptions to harvesting activities. This comprehensive integration of technologies not only enhances the quality and efficiency of tea harvesting in Idukki but also contributes to the sustainable management of tea plantations, preserving the rich cultural heritage and economic prosperity associated with this iconic industry.
